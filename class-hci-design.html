              <h2 class="contentFirst">Summary</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">Team project: </span>In a team of four, I went through an entire user-centered design cycle from identifying a problem to testing a prototype solution.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Problem statement:</span> Mandatory fire drills take up crucial class time almost every month. In a real emergency, teachers and administrators need to know ASAP where all of their students are to verify they are in a safe place. This requires communication between teachers and adminstrators. Current systems either do not facilitate communication at all or they are slow and cumbersome.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">My role: </span> development of Axure prototypes, observation of fire drill and interviews with teachers/administrators, communication with participants for evaluation, leading brainstorm sessions, problem space identification</li>
              </ul>



              <h2 class="content">Process: Learning</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">What we did: </span>We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 teachers to learn about who they are, what their specific problems are, what tasks they might want to do, and what would make our system a success. We also did some market research and found guidelines and protocols for emergencies in schools. We hoped to observe a fire drill at a school, but based on scheduling, we did this later in the process.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">What we learned: </span>There is a communication gap between teachers and administrators which likely delays the return time to classrooms. In a real emergency, this could be a safety issue.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Actions we took: </span>We developed usability criteria to measure the solution we would begin to design and prototype.</li>
              </ul>

                 <span class="emph">Analyzing the task: </span>A task analysis identifying key things the teachers and administrators need to do. A good task analysis is system agnostic, creating the most potential for development of an entirely new solution.

              <ul><li><span class="emph">Drawing board: </span>Together, we developed design alternatives. From our brainstorm session, we decided to sketch three ideas.</li></ul>

              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">Observe: </span>We visited a high school to observe a fire drill and speak with more teachers. During the drill, we observed the teachers, students, administrators, and took notes, especially on pain points. I was also able to speak with an administrator.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Participatory design:  </span>We presented our sketches and wireframe mockups of our three ideas to a few teachers to get feedback. In this way, albeit briefly, were able to involve them in our design process.</li>
              </ul>



              <h2 class="content">Process: Prototype</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">Decision-making - app: </span>Based on feedback from teachers and a class poster session, we decided to prototype a mobile app. We made this decision due to a few reasons, such as the users’ familiarity with tech, flexibility, and cost. Phones are already used for communication, so this was a natural extension.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Decision-making - Axure: </span>Based on factors like time, skills within our group, and project requirements, we decided to use Axure to prototype our app. I was able to implement the necessary front-end functionality for testing without having to worry about back-end functionality.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Functionality: </span>When developing the prototype, we kept in mind the usability specifications we developed; for example, keeping the design simple and obvious to avoid errors and be intuitive. Front-end functionality included taking attendance, messaging an administrator, and receiving announcements. </li>

However, we decided not to because we wanted to develop the best Axure prototype possible, which required our time.

              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">Decision - mock fire drill: </span>Because of research approval limitations, we decided to conduct a mock fire drill at a public library near the school where we observed the fire drill. We were lucky to have four teachers dedicate their time during a hectic school week to evaluate the app.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Evaluation techniques: </span>The evaluation included benchmark tasks to complete, a short demographics survey, a questionnaire to gather individual opinions, and a group interview. We chose a questionnaire to get unbiased feedback, and a group interview as we did not know how many participants we would have or the layout of the testing space. A group interview also made sense because it was the first real evaluation, still in the early development process with plenty of room to grow and change, and the app involves tasks with a group and facilitates communication.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="content">Conclusion</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="emph">Rewarding: </span>At the end, it was rewarding to hear the teachers say they want to use it and the administrator ask when it would be on the market. I believe this is due to how we adhered to the user-centered design process to pinpoint problems directly from the relevant people and develop solutions.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Lessons learned: </span>I discovered more about what needs to be concisely explained to someone who is not directly involved in the project: specific details about users, needs, tasks, usability criteria, evaluation techniques, results, discussion, and justification for everything.</li><br>
                <li><span class="emph">Learn more: </span>To learn even more about the project and process, look at the <a href="img/class-hci/8803_P3.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> created after prototyping but before testing.</li>
