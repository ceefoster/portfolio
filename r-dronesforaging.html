              <h2 class="contentFirst">Summary</h2>
              <p>I explored the use of DIY drones and urban foraging as an undergraduate research assistant with Professor Carl DiSalvo and two other students. For this speculative design project, I developed use cases, visualized fruit data with D3, and worked with hobby drones. We were recognized as a “student notable” project from the <a href="http://www.core77designawards.com/2014/recipients/drones-foraging/" target="_blank" class="copy"> 2014 Core77 design awards</a>.</p>

              <p>The blog I maintained throughout the work can be seen <a href="https://uavsforforaging.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" class="copy">here.</a></p>

              <h2 class="content">Process</h2>
               <p>The problem we focused on is that the use of drones is becoming more popular in big, industrial agriculture but not in small-scale or alternative agriculture. Because hobbyist drones are becoming more popular, there is something to explore. We started researching this design space by exploring relevant categories. With the information, we created an affinity diagram to help us understand the problem space. We also met with, and continued to meet with, volunteers from an urban foraging group called Concrete Jungle.</p>

               <p>To start, we went foraging ourselves to understand their process. By using their online map of fruit trees in public spaces, we visited a few locations. Given much had already been harvested and it was towards the end of the season, we just managed to pick some serviceberries. One of the problems that Concrete Jungle faced is the inability to see if fruit trees were ready for picking. It required a member going to the location to examine the tree. This was the main task or question guiding our project: can drones be used to minimize the time and effort required to see if fruit is ready for picking? <p>

              <h2 class="content">Tech</h2>
              <p>We researched DIY drones that might fit into our project, mainly going by a reasonable price, a good support system, and customer reviews. We selected a JDrones arducopter and a Parrot 2.0. Once we became comfortable with the existing drones, which we did by flying them and video recording areas around the fruit trees, we explored more specific areas.</p>

              <p>I worked on understanding image recognition algorithms to see if the drone could recognize fruit on trees and whether or not it’s ripe - by color and shape. Given the complexity of this subject, I looked into ImageJ, an open-source program typically used for cell recognition in biology work. It recognized most apples, since they are round, but ultimately wasn’t suited for our purposes.</p>

              <h2 class="content">Design</h2>
              <p>Based on what Concrete Jungle does, we developed use cases and user stories, to help us understand their needs. Since the project was more speculative than product-driven, two of my main deliverables were interactive visualizations and design documentation.</p>

              <p>The interactive visualizations were to help Concrete Jungle understand the various amount of fruit tree types in the city. Using their data, I used d3 to create interactive bar charts. The design documentation covered the work I did with ImageJ in the form of a tutorial or walkthrough to enable others to repeat the process. </p>
