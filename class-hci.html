              <h2 class="contentFirst">Summary</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>In a team of four, I went through an entire user-centered design cycle from identifying a problem to testing a prototype solution.</li>
                <li>Problem statement: Mandatory fire drills take up crucial class time almost every month. In a real emergency, teachers and administrators need to know ASAP where all of their students are to verify they are in a safe place. This requires communication between teachers and adminstrators. Current systems either do not facilitate communication at all or they are slow and cumbersome.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>To identify a problem space, I spoke with a friend who is a teacher to learn about her work and problems she regularly encounters. She described to me an issue that takes away from instruction time: fire drills. Frequent fire drills that schools are required to have take away from classroom time, and often take longer than they should be due to lack of communication between teachers and administrators. We initially decided to frame this problem from kindergarten to 12th grade, including not only fire drills but also intruder and severe weather drills. During the course of the semester, we narrowed it down to fire drills in high schools. Our reasoning was that high schools are the most chaotic environments - students are less likely to mind their teachers - and fire drills require the most movement of everyone. Solve the problem in this context, and the solution should easily extend to other, less complicated situation.</p>

              <p><span class="emph">My role: </span> development of Axure prototypes, observation of fire drill and interviews with teachers/administrators, communication with participants for evaluation, leading brainstorm sessions, problem space identification</p>


              <h2 class="content">Process: Problem Space</h2>
               <p>Our first step was to understand more about the problem space. In addition to verifying that is is a problem for multiple teachers and schools, we wanted to know exactly who our potential users are, what tasks they might want to do, what our system should do, and what would make our system a success. To begin, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 people between the four of us. I spoke with three teachers. From these interviews, we learned that there is a communication gap between teachers and administrators which likely delays the return time to classrooms. In addition to speaking with our potential users, we also researched any existing commercial systems. We didn’t find any solution for our problem, but we did learn about emergency preparation plans. Based on our findings, we developed usability criteria to measure our future solution, as well as implications to guide our design development. </p>

                 <span class="emph">Analyzing the task: </span>A task analysis identifying key things the teachers and administrators need to do. A good task analysis is system agnostic, creating the most potential for development of an entirely new solution. 
                </div>

              <h2 class="content">Process: Design Alternatives</h2>
              <p>Together, we developed design alternatives. From our brainstorm session, we decided to sketch three ideas. In addition to a mobile app, we also explored a wearable jacket and a Google Glass app. At this point in time, we were able to visit a high school to observe a fire drill and speak with more teachers. Before the drill, we presented our sketches and wireframe mockups of our three ideas to a few teachers to get feedback. During the drill, we observed the teachers, students, and administrators, and took notes, especially on pain points. I was also able to speak with an administrator; because they are incredibly busy, an appointment couldn’t be scheduled, but he had some free time after the drill. Based on all of their feedback, plus feedback from a class poster session, we decided to prototype a mobile app. We made this decision due to a few reasons, such as the users’ familiarity with tech, flexibility, and cost. Phones are already used for communication, so this was a natural extension. </p>

              <h2 class="content">Process: Prototype</h2>
              <p>Based on factors like time, skills within our group, and project requirements, we decided to use Axure to prototype our app. I was able to implement the necessary front-end functionality for testing without having to worry about back-end functionality. When developing the prototype, we kept in mind the usability specifications we developed; for example, keeping the design simple and obvious to avoid errors and be intuitive. Front-end functionality included taking attendance, messaging an administrator, and receiving announcements. </p>

              <h2 class="content">Process: Evaluation</h2>
              <p>Because of research approval limitations, we decided to conduct a mock fire drill at a public library near the school where we observed the fire drill. We were lucky to have four teachers dedicate their time during a hectic school week to evaluate the app. The evaluation included benchmark tasks to complete, a short demographics survey, a questionnaire to gather individual opinions, and a group interview. We chose a questionnaire to get unbiased feedback, and a group interview as we did not know how many participants we would have or the layout of the testing space. A group interview also made sense because it was the first real evaluation, still in the early development process with plenty of room to grow and change, and the app involves tasks with a group and facilitates communication. </p>


              <h2 class="content">Conclusion</h2>
              <p>While many of my other projects have involved some component of the user-centered design process, this project was my first that encompassed the entire cycle (or at least one iteration). At the end, it was rewarding to hear the teachers say they want to use it and the administrator ask when it would be on the market. I believe this is due to how we adhered to the user-centered design process to pinpoint problems directly from the relevant people and develop solutions. Documentation was also important for the project. While I came into the project a strong writer, I learned more about what needs to be concisely explained to someone who is not directly involved in the project: specific details about users, needs, tasks, usability criteria, evaluation techniques, results, discussion, and justification for everything.</p>
              <p>To learn even more about the project and process, look at the <a href="img/class-hci/8803_P3.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> created after prototyping but before testing.</p>
              <p>This project comes from the Intro to HCI class; its <a href="http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/~walkerb/classes/ms-hci/index.html" alt="HCI course website">website</a> includes the syllabus, project and homework descriptions, and readings.</p>
