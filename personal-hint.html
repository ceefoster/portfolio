              <h2 class="contentFirst">Introduction</h2>
              <p>Bark Hint is a project that began as a class homework assignment aimed at demonstrating our individual design skills. I identified and explored a problem space, designed a solution, and developed a low-fidelity prototype.</p>

              <h2 class="content">Background - Problem Space</h2>
              <p>People, as individuals, are busy and forgetful. Families, large and small, are often not at home
              at the same time. Chores are forgotten, schedules are miscommunicated. There is a plethora of
              smartphone apps to facilitate communication, but most, if not all, require significant setup and
              are not situationally aware. The phone might know it’s at home via GPS or WiFi, but unless
              there is Bluetooth in every room, it only knows that it’s at home and nothing more specific. There
              are many tasks that one needs to be reminded of: starting, running, unloading both the
              dishwasher and the washer/dryer; folding clothes; prepping dinner, making snacks, cleaning the
              kitchen; taking out the trash; etc.</p>
              <p>A specific issue involves other beings in the home that can’t
              communicate with us via speech or text, at least not yet. Often pets are accidentally neglected,
              even if for a relatively short period of time. For example, one morning, someone forgot to feed
              the dog, or all parties involved assumed the other party was responsible for the task. Other
              things the dog might need, but might be forgotten by the human, include a trip outside for relief
              or their medication. An individual dog owner might forget, families might collectively forget or
              miscommunicate as discussed, and then there are other caretakers like friends or dog sitters.
              How can the relevant parties communicate, without the need to constantly send text messages
              or download another smartphone app? What gentle reminders, within the home, can be given to
              the human to provide care?</p>

              <p>For some of these tasks, solutions already exist. To feed the dog, there are automatic pet
              feeders which can release food via a smartphone. However, this removes the human-dog
              interaction, which, hopefully, is the reason the dog was adopted in the first place. Rather than
              removing this interaction, the owner should be gently reminded that their dog is probably
              hungry. Trained dogs might be able to ring a bell to go outside, but not all dogs can. And this
              doesn’t provide a solution if there is no one home and whoever left last forgot to give the dog a
              chance to go outside. Finally, there are automatic pill dispensers for humans that could likely be
              appropriated for pets, but again, it removes the human-dog interaction and would also only work
              if it were a tasty pill.<p>



              <h2 class="content">Task</h2>
              <p>The task, from the user perspective, is to take care of their dog at the appropriate time. This
              includes 1) remembering the needs of their dog, at the appropriate time, and 2) attending to
              their needs. “Appropriate” time means the time at which the dog needs the care and the user is
              available to give it. The user should also be able to find out if their dog’s needs have been
              attended to by another involved person. The task, from the system perspective, is to
              automatically recognize and display to the human the current state of the dog’s needs. Again,
              these needs include taking the dog out, feeding the dog, and giving the dog any necessary
              medication.</p>


              <h2 class="content">Users</h2>
              <p>The users of this system are anyone responsible for the care of a dog (or dogs) in a household.
              This leads to a broad range of user characteristics: from children, if given responsibility by
              parents, to older adults. It might be a single individual, a family of four, or an extended family of
              10 all living together. It will be assumed the users are responsible and generally enthusiastic
              about their dog, but possibly forgetful. Not all users are “tech savvy”, since “dog owners”
              encompasses such a range of people.</p>

              <h2 class="content">Implications</h2>
              <p><ul class="contentlist">
              <li>The system should encourage interaction with the dog. (Because the users love their dog but
              can be forgetful).</li>
              <li>The system should inform the user on whether or not the dog’s needs have been attended to.
              (Because there might be miscommunication among household members).</li>
              <li>The system should provide this information as a gentle reminder, not in an accusatory
              manner. (Because the users love their dog and thus will respond to a helpful reminder).</li>
              <li>The system should not require additional steps to obtain this information. (Because the users
              are busy and need to act quickly).</li>
              <li>The system should be integrated with household items or the general household
              environment. (Because the system will be situated in the dog’s home).</li>
              <li>The system should be aware of the dog’s ideal patterns of care, like when he should be fed,
              taken out, given medication. (Because the user needs to informed at the appropriate time).</li>
              </ul></p>


                
              <h2 class="content">Solution</h2>
              <p>To take advantage of the household environment, the design will focus on feedback within the
              items associated with each need of the dog. There will be consistent visual cues using color tied
              with each item. Green will mean the task has been taken care of, yellow will signify that is
              around the time the task is typically completed, and blue will represent that it has been at least
              an hour since the time the task is typically completed. Green typically signifies “OK”, yellow is a
              bright, visible color that grabs attention, and blue is not accusatory like red, and it can be
              interpreted as “sad” because the dog hasn’t been attended to. The task the user does for all of
              these solutions is attending to the dog at the appropriate time. By feeding, taking out, and giving
              medication to the dog, the user is completing the task, and the system responds with
              appropriate feedback.</p>

                      <br><br>Example: If the owner(s) feed the dog around 8 a.m. and then again around 6 p.m., the
                      bowl will show yellow from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., or until the task is completed. If the
                      task is not completed by 8:30 a.m., it will show blue until the task is completed. Once the
                      task is completed, it will glow green until 5:30 p.m., when it will turn yellow and repeat
                      the pattern again.

                      <span class="emph">2. Walking or Going Out: </span> Rather than attaching something to the leash, which might be in the
                      way while actually using it, the hook (or its mount) for the leash will change colors.
                      Removing the leash does not necessarily signify that the dog is going on a walk or getting
                      exercise. However, we are assuming it means the dog is “out” and most good dog owners
                      let dogs go potty while “out”.
                      <br><br>Example: If the owner normally takes the dog out every six hours, then from the time that
                      the dog returns from outside up until five and half hours later, the hook will be green.
                      From five and a half hours from the last time out to six and a half hours from the last time
                      out, the hook will be yellow. Anytime past six and a half hours from the last time out, the
                      hook will be blue.
                      <br><br><br>

                    <div class="carousel-caption">
                      <span class="emph">3. Medicine: </span>
                      Because medicine might be in liquid, pill, or treat form, a special storage unit that
                      contains the medicine will act as the visual cue.
                      <br><br>Example: If the dog needs to have a pill mixed in with a treat at 9 p.m., then the box will
                      remain green until 8:45 p.m. at which point it will turn and remain yellow until 9:15 p.m.
                      Afterwards, it will be blue until the medication is taken. A shorter time interval exists for
                      this device because timely medication is likely more important than timely going out or
                      feeding.
                      With any digital product, there is some sort of setup. The devices will be connected via WiFi,
                      and variables like time setup online. This separate interface is given less attention since it is
                      infrequently used.

                      <span class="emph">Bringing it all together: </span>In addition to the responsive objects, a “task” chart that is aesthetically pleasing will be available to hang on a wall. Users can choose whether or not to use this in addition to the objects. It can
                      be placed in a room that is frequently used or an area that is passed by often. This would be
                      appropriate if the items (food bowl, leash, medication box) are typically kept out of sight. If the
                      user chooses, the chart can make an unobtrusive sound when the color changes from green to
                      yellow, halfway through the yellow period, and then yellow to blue. This would be appropriate for
                      situations where the user sees the color change, then promptly forgets again; as well as those
                      who are visually impaired. The auditory cue can be decoupled from the “task” chart and used as
                      a standalone speaker output. Having visual cues, and minimal auditory cues, stems from design
                      implications like the user should be gently reminded in a non-accusatory manner, and the user
                      doesn’t have to take any additional steps - the information is automatic and always present.

              <h2 class="content">Prototype</h2>
              <p>I created a quick prototype of the dog bowl, using an existing dog bowl (why make a new one when it already exists, at this stage?) and 3 LEDs. A force-sensitive resistor attached to the bottom of the bowl detects change in weight. For purposes of the prototype, I manually set the LEDs to change quickly in order to show what would happen over a longer period of time.</p>
              <p>Next I will solder the parts together and design a dog bowl to 3D print. For a higher-fidelity prototype, I need a custom dog bowl with a paw print to light up with LEDs, and housing underneath for the hardware.</p>
              <p>In theory, this system could be expanded as activity recognition technologies grow.</p>
